##General Lore
	
 TheOfficerHat is a friendly guy with many connections all over the world, but some of those ties are dangerous — including the likes of █████, █████, and other Gods themselves.
 Little do they know he carries a second personality within him, one that is pure Evil, waiting for its chance to rise.

Behaviour				

 His “Good Side” appears more often than his Evil, but records state that the “Good Side” is slowly fading away. Piece by piece, the Evil within him shows itself more often, clouding his judgment and pushing him toward darker deeds.
 Since his Evil side has its own ideas, he began lending his hand to the Gods and their twisted plans.███████████████████.He even allied himself with another guy named █████ who shares the same mindset.
