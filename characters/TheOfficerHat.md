## General Lore

TheOfficerHat is a friendly guy with many friends all over the world, but some of those friends are as dangerous as gods themselves.
Little do they know he carries a second personality within him, one that is pure evil, wanting to see the world on fire.

## Behaviour

His “good side” appears more often than his evil, but records state that the “good side” is slowly fading away. Day after day, the evil within him shows itself more often, changing his judgment and pushing him toward darker deeds. Since his evil side has its own ideas (for example: chaos), he began helping his (not-so-nice) friends and their plans. He even allied himself with someone who shares his ideas.

## Notes

His “second personality” is a different… - - - - Redacted - - - - …within him.
