Resin X Fangs Lore

Resin is a character from the far reaches of the Multiverse. His universe was the last one created, granting him a power that no one else should possess. Resin was just an ordinary human, but when he and his friends decided to explore an area claimed by the government, they sneaked in and discovered an ancient temple. They faced several challenges and even traversed deadly environments. Eventually, they reached the end of the temple, where they found a statue made of gold, its eyes marked by two stripes. While all but one of his friends questioned the worth of their journey, Resin grabbed the statue, setting off a massive blast that destroyed their universe, leaving only Resin to witness the devastation as he was transported to a new world.
Legend has it that this statue bestowed its user with the ability to teleport anywhere or gain extraordinary abilities. However, over the years, Resin discovered that every time he died, he found himself in a new multiverse or universe. Whenever someone gazed into his true eyes, they would be reduced to ashes and fire, leading Resin to seek a mask to wear for protection.
Fang, another character, emerged from the first universe created within Resin's and Fang's multiverse. Unbeknownst to them, they experienced the same fateful event at the same time. This incident fused their essences into one, resulting in a duality: Fang yearned for chaos and destruction, while Resin sought peace. Consequently, whenever Resin or Fang fell asleep, the one who slept would transform into the other's enemy—themselves. alongside a different person called Fang
Fang was the first universe to be created in the resins and fangs' multiverse, and the same events occurred simultaneously for resin and fang. This event fused these 2 into 1. The difference between them was that Fang wanted murder while Resin wanted peace. And so every time resin or fang fell asleep, those who fell asleep would turn into their enemy.

Them selves…..
