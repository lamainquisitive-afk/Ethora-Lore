# 			 ***General Lore***

Heti was going Insane in his past life and somehow found a way to reincarnate himself into this new World.

He also pissed of a God in his old world and is scared of the fact that the God Followed him so he’s a bit weird when talking to people and always Paranoid.

Still he fights for the side he believes is the Good side since he’s never really wanted to hurt anyone.

# 		            ***Behaviour***

Heti seems to be trying to recover from his craziness in his last world by teaching his knowledge to other people.

He also is trying to hide from this “God” as he calls it (Tho we haven’t seen “it” yet).He started building tunnels and underground hallways to hide and escape if he ever got attacked by “it”.

Note: This “God” hasn’t been seen or measured so we think he is going crazy after all he built in his last “World” as he calls it tho the Theory of multiple dimensions haven’t been proven yet. Tho we have a theory that it could work with a Time and relative dimension in a space machine. Short T.A.R.D.I.S.  Tho we still have to figure that whole Machinery out and maybe we can do it and Investigate more on this “God”

##   ***Theories and Concerns***

Heti doesn't seem to be harmless but also doesn’t want to harm anybody. We are very scared to investigate further on this case since we don't know what he’ll do if he finds us Investigating his stuff. He might try to sacrifice us to this “God” to keep himself safe but most of us dont think he is a threat. We classified him as a D level in Harm and we will try to talk to him if we have the chance but we don't want to show us too much or else he may adapt to it and find out our Hideout at the Operation .
