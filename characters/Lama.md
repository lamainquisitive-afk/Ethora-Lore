## General Lore
lama is a person who doesn't seem to fit any previous known species although there name would suggest maybe they aimed to be a llama although the misspelling may suggest a failure to do so.

lama also seems to be able to change outfit when swapping universe we do not understand in which time they are able to do this as our current understanding of multiversal travel would suggest that there is no space between universes. 

we also believe they may have some sort of infection that is non transmittable with a similar composition to that of sculk found in deep caverns, we do not understand how it came to be on them but are current guess is that they may have warped into a universe with a variation of sculk that could take form on a living creature.

## Believed Personality
we currently have very little understanding of the beings personality as it seems to wildly swing depending on the universe they exist in.
they also seem to show clear signs of trust towards people although on occasion have had said trust broken causing them to become slightly murderous we have determined the safest solution to this in general life is to hide or to try to stay away from direct contact.

## Current known history
although we do not understand how it would appear they have created the industry corporation even though it has existed since before they were discovered.
it is believed that during the founding of the industry corporation a second entity helped we currently do not know who it is as that information is locked beyond public viewing.

## current understanding
it is currently believed that the entity is wishing to live a more peaceful life but also no sustained communication has been made with the entity and it is currently believed that it may have found a way to exist between universes we do not understand how this is possible but it is currently the only logical explanation for its disappearance.
it is also believed based on the expected location for the entity to appear at that it may be wearing some kind of clothing made from plants although details about this are unknown.

## Unverified Information
according to one of the scientists working on multiversal entities who found a piece of the clothing of this entity its clothes are not made of any known material and seem to be able to produce power although this power seems to destroy itself.
this claim was denied as possible as it goes against current scientific study although we do not know the origin of this entity so it may be possible.

it is also believed that the entity may not be able to travel universes itself but may use some form of energy from a unknown source we currently believe this may be the "point between universes" although this is unconfirmed. its multiversal location has been said to be consistently at ████████ we believe this may be some sort of ███████████████████ as its mathematically at the centre of all recorded multiverse locations.
This info cannot be confirmed as a multiversal tear destroyed a databank off all multiverse locations and no expeditions to explore the idea of mapping multiverses has been done since.

## Recorded sightings
there have been 3 recorded sightings of the entity one was withing a universe known as discontented it is believed this universe has long since collapsed,

we also have 2 sightings from a universe known as Ethora this is one of the universes that seems to be able to restart itself and almost may have died but seems to be recovering in its third "big bang"

## Industry Corporation
the industry corporation has been created by the entity we still do not understand how this is possible as it would suggest the entity possesses some ability to move through time although this should be impossible by modern science
