This is the official repository for the Ethora SMP lore team

this is here to aid in the joint creation of lore for S3 and all following seasons

the 4 main files are only for lore that has been fully agreed upon by all members of lore team or a majority so do not change these files unless its a agreed change or fixing a typo or grammar error

if something you are working on is larger and requiring multiple files then store it in a folder for ease of access by all members of lore team

dont work on the same file as someone else at the same time as its easier to have seperate files for people so if you are working on someone elses file then insure that no one else is currently making changes to that file

file formats:
you can use whatever file format you prefer as theres no specific file format agreed upon for changes
